            Of the monuments, the Kankali Devi Temple is most notable and is a Gupta period temple.It is one of the oldest surviving Hindu temples,
            illustrating the formative stages of Hindu temple architecture and the essential elements found in the north Indian style through the modern era.
             It has a sanctum and an open portico supported on four pillars. The sides of the portico were filled in with walls containing panels at a later period. The sanctuary is, and always was, covered with a
             flat roof, and is generally very similar to the Gupta period Temple 17 at Sanchi.
