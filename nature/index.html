                  The Dumna Nature Reserve (DNR) of Jabalpur Municipal Corporation is spread over nearly 1800 acres of forested land on a plateau, about 40 meters above Jabalpur town. It was transferred to the Municipal Committee of Jubbulpore by the provincial government to act as the catchment area for the Khandari lake. The construction of Khandari Dam materialized in February 1883 under J.H. Morris, Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces and Berar. Since then, the forested area provides rainwater to feed the Khandari Reservoir.
