                  First on the list of famous waterfalls in Jabalpur is the Nidan waterfall. It is one of the most beautiful waterfalls of Madhya Pradesh. Also known as the Katangi falls, it is located at a distance of 30 km from the main Jabalpur City. The water here slowly tickles down the staircase like a formation of black rocks standing at a height of 30 m. 
                  This prevents the harsh flow and makes for a pleasing and serene site to relax and rejuvenate in the lap of mother nature.

            Yet another cooling and the crowning glory of waterfalls in Jabalpur is the Dhuandhar Fall. Originally known as the Smoke Cascade, the Dhuandhar Waterfall in Jabalpur attracts travellers with its astonishing marble mountains standing at a height of 30m on the holy Narmada River. The water here makes its way through the rocky marble mountains and forcefully plunges, creating a mass of mist that justifies its name ‘Dhuandhar’. The force of falling water is so strong that it can be heard from far off places as well. The place is also famous among locals as Jabalpur Bhedaghat waterfall as it is located in the Bhedaghat village.
