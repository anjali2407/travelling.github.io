              Situated atop a hill in Jabalpur city is a small but enchanting fort of the Rajgond rulers. It was more of a manned post on vigil for invaders now enveloped in shroud of history. The fort dates back to 11th century AD. The fort is well associated with Rani Durgavati the Gond Queen and her son Veer Narayan. Rani Durgavati eventually died fighting the mughals and is hailed as a martyr in Indian history. She also built numerous temples and tanks scattered around Jabalpur chiefly around her Garha principality
